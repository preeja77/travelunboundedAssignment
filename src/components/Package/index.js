        Wake up early. Freshen yourself and head to the restaurant for a hot cup
        of coffee or tea. The mornings are cold at Mara, so do wear your fleece
        jacket for the morning game drive. Breakfast would be packed for you.
        Explore the mornings at Mara. The Sunrise you witness at Mara is
        something which you would never get to witness anywhere in the World.
        Just pray that it does not rain!!
        <br />
        Our guides would park the vehicle under a tree for you to have a bush
        breakfast. This is an out of the World experience. At a distance you can
        see the animals peacefully grazing while you are enjoying your food.
        Post your breakfast, proceed again on the game drive. Mid mornings while
        the Lions sleep is a good time to look around for the cheetahs. November
        is also the season when the Topis give birth to young ones. On a lucky
        day, you might witness a Topi giving birth to a little one. Keep a watch
        on the hyenas as they would always be around a pregnant Topi!
        <br />
        Return to your camp around 11.30AM. Take a nice shower and some much
        needed rest. Lunch would be served from 12.30 Noon. Have a hot lunch and
        a short nap. The afternoon game drive would start at 3PM. Today our
        drivers would try and locate a leopard for you.
        <br />
        Do ask your driver to stop where ever you want to click pictures. Return
        to the camp post sunset and enjoy your evening at the camp fire with
        your group. Have dinner and retire early as you have a full day game
        drive tomorrow.

        Today is a very busy day for you at Mara. Wake up early, freshen
        yourself, have a hot beverage and jump into your designated vehicles.
        Today you would be going towards the border of Maasai Mara. You would be
        going for a full day game drive with packed breakfast and lunch. Sand
        river is the border for Maasai Mara and Tanzania. This has been the
        entry point of the migratory animals for millions of years. You would be
        amazed to see such a small river separates two different countries!!
        Enjoy every bit your time as this is your last day of game drive for
        this trip. Have lunch and take a small nap like our Maasai guides. Then
        proceed towards your camp. On the way back encounter a pride of lion.
        During your stay at Mara, you would have seen the Big 4 our of the Big
        5. The Rhino being very elusive is going to be a difficult find. But
        this area is know for the Rhinos. If you are lucky you would get to see
        one. Return to the camp with great memories. Spend you evening at the
        camp fire before having dinner. Retire for the day. Sadly the holiday
        has come to an end. But at the end you would release that it was the
        journey which was so beautiful. Have a blissful night.
